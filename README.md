# python_basics
Repository to keep track of my progress in learning python.
This will serve as a quick refrence and reminder to myself and whomever would be interested.

The input has been gathered from many sources in the last year or so, gradually building my passive understanding of the language, 
but here I want to organize it a bit better.

The first commits will be proudly copied from FreeCodeCamp Harvard CS50â€™s Introduction to Programming with Python featuring 
Dr. David J. Malan, who does a great job explaining the basics and the more advanced features of python.
